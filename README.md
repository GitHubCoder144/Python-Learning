# Python Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository contains my personal journey learning Python programming which will lays the foundation for a larger OS Project.

## Purpose

- Practice Python basics and advanced concepts
- Write small scripts and exercises
- Build foundational skills for the Linux Bug Testing Automation Tool.  

## What’s Inside

- `lesson1_basics.py`: Introduction to Python basics like print, input, and variables
- `lesson2_functions.py`: Learning how to write reusable functions
- `lesson3_subprocess.py`: Running system commands from Python scripts
- More lessons and practice scripts added as I learn

## How This Builds Toward My Automation Tool

This repo lays the groundwork for a more advanced project I am developing:  
**an automation tool for testing Linux packages on Fedora and eventually other operating systems.**

By mastering Python fundamentals and learning to run system commands, I’ll be able to:  
- Automate package installation and verification  
- Detect faulty or broken packages  
- Log and report testing results  

This foundational knowledge will enable me to build a robust, open-source tool that helps improve Linux package quality.

## Why I’m Doing This

I want to improve my programming skills by building practical tools. This repo documents my progress, so I can reflect on what I learn and share my code with others.

## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to browse, learn from the scripts, or contribute if you want to help me improve!
