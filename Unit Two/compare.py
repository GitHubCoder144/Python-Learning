x = int(input("What is x?"))

if x == y:

else:
    print("x is not equal to y")

# Not Equal
# !=

# or
# if x > y or x < y

# Longer Version
# if x < y:
    #print("x is less than y")

#elif x > y:
    #print("x is greater than y")

#else:
    #print("x is equal to y")

# We Can Also Use If But Slower for last two

# if x < y:
    # print("x is less than y")

# if x > y:
    # print("x is greater than y")

# We Can also use elif for the last one if elif

#elif x == y:
    #print("x is equal to y")
